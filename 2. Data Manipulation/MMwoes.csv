After graduation I was searching for a job for about a month or so before I had found one. The job I found required me to relocate from California to Texas. The company was supposed to reimburse me for moving expenses however it didn't quite work out that way. After I got there I realized that the company wasn't for me. I also felt that there were too many things left behind back in California that were important to me so I returned home. I've been working a ""transitional"" job for the last few months while searching for another job in my industry. I've recently found a few promising leads and hope they work out the way I think they will.",debt_consolidation,After college credit card pay down,huntington Beach,CA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,9.73,0,0,08/12/03 10:40,725,729,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3,NA,0,NA,6282,44.60%,NA,9,f,0,0,7541.53,7370.77,6625,916.53,0,01/03/11,424.12,null,16/06/11,714,710

I'm a recently engaged, hardworking professional in my mid-20's who is trying to start a new life with my partner, but several roadblocks have come up along the way.  I have always been a very honest, do-it-myself kind of person. Growing up in a lower middle class family, I worked and supported myself all throughout high school and college.   I currently work as a program director at a nonprofit organization that provides clinical, legal, and shelter services to domestic violence victims. It is a salaried position with full benefits (but the salary is at a typical nonprofit level). My partner is an artist/illustrator. We both work very hard and do not have a lavish lifestyle at all. We've tried to be frugal and save, but my partner recently had some legal, automobile, and medical costs to pay for which wiped out our savings.  My partner has sold the car, I have taken on a freelance job in addition to my full-time job, and now we are looking to move to a cheaper apartment as well as eventually get married. A loan of $10,000 would allow us to pay the last month's rent on the current apartment, pay for the security/first/last on a new, more affordable apartment, pay for moving expenses (we do not have much furniture or possessions), pay off my partner's legal and medical expenses, and maybe set aside some for our new life together.  I'm not proud to be requesting money from strangers because I've always tried to work my way through life and figure things out, but the situation has just become so tough and desperate with the fact I need to support my partner, and I would do anything for us to have a life together. Moving to a cheaper apartment and paying off the unexpected legal, automobile, and medical expenses will allow us to better manage our income and get back on our feet, and our top priority would be paying back this loan.  Also, I'm not quite sure how this process works as I've never done it before, but we currently live in New York but I was originally based in New Jersey, so that is why my location indicates New Jersey (we may also end up moving to New Jersey due to the more affordable rent).

I am a successful software engineer with 10 years experience, 5 in a big corporation, 5 as a consultant.  I have a full time consulting position but I run an additional side consulting business in a different market and therefore do not compete with my employer.  This loan will pay for lead generation and conversion, marketing materials, and escrow for subcontractors.  After many months of research and study I have determined the best ways to scale my side consulting business using less of my time and efforts.  I will expand through referral systems, passive income products such as information products and software components, and outsourcing development to qualified teams in India, Russia, etc.  My financial situation:  Don't be alarmed by my high revolving balances.  It is essentially a wash.  Whenever I receive a 0% introductory rate on a credit line, I take the money and write out-of-the-money uncovered puts at 30% equity in my brokerage account.  When the introductory rate is close to expiration, I pay the credit line back.  Unlike this loan, the good rates typically only last 6 months.  I have strong character and uphold all my obligations.  I have never missed a payment in my life. This includes the 18 month period when I had a parent near death with cancer surgeries, had my first child with my wife after being cheated out of health insurance ($50,000 loss there even though we're all perfectly healthy and had a perfect delivery), moved from one state to another, and sold two houses (I owned a rental property).

My goal is to get this card to a zero balance.  I have 2 more cards that I would like to pay off as the interest rates are near 20%.  This ties inwith my future goals of eliminating credit card debt and purchasing a house in late 2008 or 2009 or whenever the market indicators for housing start to turn more positive.  I've already cut up the cards so they will just be open credit lines to enhance my credit history when they are paid off.  The extra money I save in interest will go towards paying for my colleges classes.  I was accepted to Indiana University's distance learning program and want to focus on finishing my last year of college and paying down debt the next year(I left school to for a tech job in the mid 90's)     I'm employed by Washington state as a computer systems administrator/supervisor.  My job is vary stable and I will be receiving 2 raises in the next 8 months which will more than cover any payments I accrue here.  March will be 5% and July an additional 2%.

These debts are purchased for 3%-5% of the debt value by my company and completely followed through on via lawsuit, judgment, and execution of the judgment (payment/wage garnishment of the debt). Most collection agencies boast of a 30%-60% return by simply sending out intimidating letters and phone calls. They are simply too large of an operation and have too many accounts to file suit on all of them. By purchasing smaller batches of debts and going through the full legal process, I am able to receive a return of 60%-90% with almost no office expenses.  I have been working for a collection company (US Credit Corp.) for over 3 years collecting taxes and debts, as well as doing work in their legal department. I am well-versed in multi-State collection law, as well as the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  These loan funds will be used exclusively to purchase debts and to pay the filing fee associated with each lawsuit.  The combination of my business only being in existence for a few months and the fact that banks don't like to lend on intangible items, makes for a difficult bank-borrowing experience. I tend to pay things off early and pay for things in cash, so I don't have a very lengthy credit history, however my credit scores are still very good. I live on my father's estate, so my living expenses are almost nothing. My only real expenses are my car, food, and the rare occasion that I stop thinking about work and go out and have some fun :) I have 2 credit cards and a small car loan, all of which have never seen a late payment.

A women's clothing boutique is being sold close to where we live.  This is a great location as it is across the street from a middle school and sandwiched between a brand new neighborhood and a developing neighborhood.  It is being sold because the seller has 2 other businesses and is unable to grow & manage this boutique to achieve profitability quicker.  Though there will be seller financing, a down payment is expected and we will need some extra money to act as a buffer for intangibles.  The Good: We tend to quickly increase profitability by lowering some of the overhead costs.  We intend to sell retail as well as act as a broker for those looking to make high end specialty purchases.  We will develop the website so that it will serve as a social networking site that will allow us to take input from shoppers who are looking for unique fashions.  Items will be sold on the site, and overstock items will be directed to overseas markets.  We intend to keep inventories fairly low.  My income is sufficient to cover extra problems that may arise.  My wife is not working and will manage & grow the business full time.  The Bad: This is retail and it may not be profitable for at least 6 months (thats not your problem though....).  The customer base is undeveloped and we will need to do a significant amount of marketing to build it.  This should not be too big a problem though as my wife is a recent MBA grad.  The Ugly: I'm in grad school and my loans will come calling by the end of summer in 08.  Since my last personal loan I have not defaulted or been late with any payments, but I have gotten more credit cards and have increased my available balances on all of them very recently; this may be a why it has gone down.  Also, I've gone from W2 employee to 1099 contractor (no taxes hoooray!), the uncertainty of self employment may have altered the grade as well.   About Me: I am a DBA working in the Atlanta Metro area.  I am also an investor in a few other things as well such as ATMs and P2P lending.
